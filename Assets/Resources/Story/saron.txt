The Javanese gamelan is composed of various instruments, and each instrument have their own roles in constructing the layers of a song. 
The first, and most important class of instruments are the <b>balungan</b>, which is responsible for creating the main melodic lines. 
If we imagine gamelan music as a building, the balungan would be the pillars supporting its structure. 
Out of all the balungan instruments, the <b>saron</b> is the most well-known and most commonly used. 
It is played much like a xylophone, where each note is struck with a mallet to produce a crisp percussive tone. 
It is simple to play, yet skill and coordination is required to dampen previous notes before striking a new one, preventing dissonance in the music. 
The saron is composed of only 7 keys. There are different variations of saron, such as saron demung, saron barung and saron peking, that are tuned to different octaves. 
They are all generally played together to produce a layered sound. 
Thus we will now play the main melody of "Lagu Gugur Gunung". 
It will be a simple melody.
One that awaits other instruments to fill in the gaps in its orchestration.
